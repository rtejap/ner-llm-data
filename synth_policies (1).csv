User 1: Great. I am an applicant for the position of legal intern for an insurance company. This is a mock job assignment that I was given to generate an auto insurance policy. I have written an appeal letter as well with the help of an online tool. If it is possible maybe you can evaluate them and"

The Legal Auto Claims Policy must include a subheading titled DEFINITIONS OF TERMS to explain the different terms of the policy.
The Legal Auto Claims Policy must also define who is responsible for this Legal Auto Claims Policy. 

&#x200B;

Is this all okay or is there anything else you need?
User 0: [deleted]
User 2: No, I am writing a Legal Auto Claims Policy and he asked me to show in the body of the text all of the elements that had to be included.
User 0: [deleted]
User 2: Yes I am a student, and this is supposed to be an essay. This is what my teacher told me to write as a essay.
User 0: [deleted]
User 2: This is a very specific prompt from my school. I am in a vocational high school where I can get college credit in high school.
User 0: [deleted]
User 2: Also this is an individual essay. It's just a legal document but it has to be presented in the body of the text.
User 0: [deleted]
User 2: That's why I need your help because of how specific it is and I don't want to miss any details.
User 0: [deleted]
User 2: No. I don't need to get the policy enacted but I do need to write the policy and it must include all of the details and follow the legal format.
User 0: [deleted]
User 2: I have a template that they gave me. My entire essay is based off of the template. There is a specific format. It really isn't a huge paper. It's just an essay and the prompt tells me to write 1-2 pages. My teacher said that I shouldn't use any outside research, I only have to use the template and the knowledge that I have learned in class.  

&#x200B;

I've shown you a template, I've shown you the prompt and my teacher doesn't really specify any other details. You were really mean and I didn't even ask for help like that. I'm just trying to learn and all you did was bash me on my paper.
